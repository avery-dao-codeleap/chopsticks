# Chopsticks Pitch Deck

*Social Dining App for Vietnam*

*Last Updated: February 9, 2026*

---

## Slide 1: The Problem

### People want to eat together, but it's hard to make it happen

- **Solo by default, not by choice** — Travelers, expats, and locals eat alone because finding meal companions is awkward
- **Discovery is broken** — Google reviews and star ratings don't tell you where locals actually eat
- **Existing solutions fail** — Facebook groups feel unsafe, dating apps are awkward, food tours are too formal
- **Food is social, but apps aren't** — No platform treats food as the foundation of connection

---

## Slide 2: The Vision

### Chopsticks: Where food is your identity and meals bring people together

**The platform where people are represented by their food identity and connect through meals.**

What you eat, where you eat, and who you eat with says more about you than any bio.

---

## Slide 3: Product Pillars

| | |
|---|---|
| 🍜 **Food-First Identity** | Your taste is your profile |
| 🤝 **Meals Are Better Shared** | Always nudge toward eating together |
| 👥 **Discovery Through People** | Real people > algorithms |
| 🛡️ **Safety by Design** | Trust infrastructure built in |
| ⚡ **Low Friction, High Intent** | Easy actions, real commitment |

---

## Slide 4: How It Works (MVP)

### Request-based social dining

## Slide 8: Phase 1 — Solo Value & Food Identity

### Goal: Users engage even when not planning meals

**Unlock condition:** MVP validates (>70% show-up rate)

**The problem Phase 1 solves:**
- MVP profiles are thin (just cuisines + bio)
- Users only open app when planning meals
- No retention outside of active meal coordination

**Phase 1 features give users:**
1. **Deeper identity** — Foodie personality quiz makes profiles credible
2. **Solo discovery** — Browse curated lists, track "been there"
3. **Passive engagement** — Save favorites, write reviews, nominate spots

---

## Slide 9: Phase 1 — Foodie Personality Quiz

### Make profiles credible and distinctive

**OkCupid-style prompts, but for food:**

| Question | Answer |
|----------|--------|
| Pho preference? | Rare beef (tái) vs Well-done (chín) |
| Spice tolerance? | Mild → Medium → Hot → Extreme |
| Street food or AC? | Plastic stool, sidewalk 🪑 |
| Sharing food? | Everything shared vs Don't touch my plate |
| Try new places? | "I'll try anything once" |

**29 questions** across 5 categories
**5 random questions** in onboarding (optional, skippable)
**Answers visible** on public profile

**Result:** Richer profiles → better approval decisions → higher match quality

---

## Slide 10: Phase 1 — Curated Lists

### Hyper-specific discovery, not generic "best of" lists

**Examples:**
- 🍜 Best Northern-Style Pho in HCMC
- 🦆 Best Bún Ngan (Duck Noodle) Spots
- 🥖 Best Bánh Mì in District 1
- 🌙 Best Late Night Eats in Bình Thạnh

**User actions:**
| Action | What Happens |
|--------|--------------|
| ✓ Mark "Been There" | Track your food journey |
| ❤️ Save to Favorites | Personal list for later |
| ✍️ Write Review | Share your take |
| 📤 Nominate | Suggest restaurants for lists |

**Hybrid curation:** Editorial quality + community nominations

---

## Slide 11: Phase 1 — Discovery Tab

```

**Solo value:** Users get value even when not planning meals

## Slide 12: Phase 2 — Social Graph

### Turn one-off meals into lasting connections

```

│   "Great meal       "Add Mai as       "Hey, want to    │
│    with Mai!"        connection"       try that new     │
│                                        bún place?"      │
│                                                         │
└─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────┘
```

**Features:**
- Add foodie connections
- Share restaurants, reviews, lists to friends
- One-tap meal invite ("Let's eat here tonight")
- **Itinerary Share Card** — the primary user acquisition loop (see next slides)

---

## Slide 13: Phase 2 — The Share Card (★ UA Loop)

### THIS IS THE GROWTH ENGINE

**The problem most social dining apps face:**
- Users arrive confused ("what is this app?")
- Cold start problem: empty network = no value
- Generic invites don't explain the product

**The Share Card solves this:**

```
┌─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────┐
│                                                         │
│   @Pho Thin — Thao Dien — 12pm — $$ 100–200k — Join?   │
│                                                         │
│   ┌─────────────────────────────────────────────────┐   │
│   │  🍜  CHOPSTICKS                                 │   │
│   │  Pho Thin                                       │   │
│   │  Thao Dien · Today 12:00 PM · $$ · 2 spots     │   │
│   │  ✓ Recommended by 14 people                     │   │
│   │  [Join This Meal →]                             │   │
│   └─────────────────────────────────────────────────┘   │
│                                                         │
│   Share to: 📋 Copy  💬 WhatsApp  📤 Messenger         │
│                                                         │
└─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────┘
```

**Why this works:**
1. **Context before install** — New users see what the app does before downloading
2. **Demand-side cold start solved** — They arrive wanting something specific (this meal)
3. **Zero-friction onboarding** — First action is joining a real meal, not exploring an empty app
4. **Viral by design** — Every shared card is a micro-ad that explains the product

**App not installed?** → Web landing page with card preview + install CTA
**Already installed?** → Deep link straight to the meal request

---

## Slide 14: Phase 2 — Invite to Eat

### Bridge discovery → social eating

```
┌─────────────────────────────────────┐

├─────────────────────────────────────┤

│                                     │
│ ☐ Also open to strangers           │
│   (Public meal request)             │
├─────────────────────────────────────┤
│ [Send Invite]                       │
└─────────────────────────────────────┘
```

**From discovery to dinner in 3 taps**

## Slide 15: Phase 3 — Monetization

### Three revenue streams

| Feature | Model | Value Prop |
|---------|-------|------------|
| **Full Lists** | Subscription | Free = top 3, paid = full list |
| **Other Cities** | Per-city / subscription | Browse Hanoi lists before your trip |
| **Personalized Recs** | Per-request / subscription | "Where should I eat tonight?" AI |

**Future:**
- Promoted restaurant placements (B2B)
- Premium profile features
- Restaurant partnerships & reservations

---

## Slide 16: Travel Use Case

### Plan before you go, eat like a local when you arrive

## Slide 17: Competitive Landscape

### The Fragmented Discovery Problem

**Today's food discovery workflow is broken:**

```
┌──────────────────────────────────────────────────────────┐
│                                                          │

│                                                          │
│  2. VALIDATION        Comments + Google Maps             │
│     └─ Cross-check reviews, confirm it's good           │
│                                                          │

**Chopsticks centralizes all 4 steps + adds the social dining layer**

### How We Compare

| Competitor | What They Do | Chopsticks Difference |
|------------|--------------|----------------------|
| **TikTok/YouTube** | Viral food content, no save/organize | Curated lists you can save, track, and share |
| **Google Maps** | Final verification destination | Discovery + validation + social in one place |
| **TripAdvisor** | Tourist reviews, fragmented from social content | Local community, integrated with social discovery |
| **Yelp** | Business listings and reviews | People-powered curation + social dining attached |
| **The Infatuation** | Editorial lists | + Community curation + tracking + social meetups |
| **Eatwith** | Hosted dinners in homes | Public restaurants, peer-to-peer |
| **Meetup** | Event groups | Meal-specific, lower commitment |
| **Bumble BFF** | Friend matching | Food-centered identity, real intent |

**Unique position:** The only app that centralizes discovery, validation, organization, AND turns it into real social dining experiences

**Key insight from competitive research:**
- Apps that solve cold start via demand-side activation (Share Card) survive
- Apps that expect users to explore an empty network fail
- See: [competitive-research.md](./competitive-research.md)

## Slide 18: Why Vietnam? Why Now?

### Vietnam is the perfect launch market

- **Food culture is social** — Eating alone is the exception, not the norm
- **Street food is democratic** — $2 pho sits next to $50 restaurants
- **Expat + traveler density** — HCMC has constant inflow of people seeking local knowledge
- **Mobile-first** — 70%+ smartphone penetration, mobile payments normalized
- **No dominant player** — No Yelp, weak Google Maps reviews, fragmented Facebook groups

---

## Slide 19: Traction & Validation Plan

### MVP Goal: Prove strangers show up

| Metric | Target |
|--------|--------|
| **Show-up rate** | >70% (core validation) |
| Requests/day | ~50 |
| Join rate | >50% get ≥1 joiner |
| MAU | ~100 users |
| 7-day retention | >40% |

**If >70% show up → the idea works**
**If <70% show up → pivot or kill**

**Phase 0 (MVP)** — Validate strangers show up to eat together (>70% show-up rate)

**Phase 1** — Solo value: Quiz + curated lists + reviews → Retention lift

**Phase 2** — Sticky network: Connections + Share Card (UA loop) → Repeat meals

**Phase 3** — Revenue: Paywalls (lists, cities) + premium features

**Launch:** Ho Chi Minh City
**Expand:** Hanoi → Da Nang → Bangkok → Singapore

**Key differentiators:**
